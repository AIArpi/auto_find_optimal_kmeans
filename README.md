Automated selection of k in k-means clustering is a challanging problem in unsupervised machine learning.
Often you need to select the cluster number autimatically & passing it to another function without human interaction.
While you can argue against that you can't get always the optimal k very ofthen this solution is usually good enough.

Requirements:
Numpy & Mathplotlib

Basic usage:
Copy the code to Python or Jupyter Notebook
